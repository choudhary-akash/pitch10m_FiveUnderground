Hello everyone. So in this video we are going to understand about the chemical law

00:07.988 --> 00:11.454
of equivalence. Here we will just understand the basic of it,

00:11.492 --> 00:15.066
okay? The overall chemical law of equivalence will be taught

00:15.098 --> 00:19.290
to you in the redox chapter or in the stichometric

00:19.370 --> 00:21.982
part two or what we call it mole concept part two,

00:22.036 --> 00:25.814
okay? But here we are going to just cover the basic part of

00:25.852 --> 00:29.222
chemical Law of Equivalence. What chemical law of equivalence is?

00:29.276 --> 00:32.822
Basically, for that you must have an idea of equivalence first.

00:32.956 --> 00:36.546
If not, then go and watch the video where I have taught you the equivalence,

00:36.578 --> 00:39.894
okay? Because without equivalence, you will not be able to understand the chemical

00:39.942 --> 00:43.882
law of equivalence. So let's understand what

00:43.936 --> 00:46.922
basically chemical law of equivalence is state, okay?

00:46.976 --> 00:50.586
So what basically equivalence law of equivalence

00:50.618 --> 00:54.778
is. So law state that one equivalent

00:54.954 --> 00:58.062
of an element combines with one

00:58.116 --> 01:01.290
equivalent of the other. So if there is a reaction,

01:01.370 --> 01:04.526
okay, if there is any reaction and that need not to be

01:04.548 --> 01:08.126
balanced actually, this is the advantage of law of Equivalence that you don't

01:08.158 --> 01:11.086
need a balanced reaction to apply the law of equivalence.

01:11.198 --> 01:14.890
Law of Equivalence can be applied to unbalanced reactions

01:14.990 --> 01:18.418
also. It can be applied to unbalanced reactions

01:18.514 --> 01:21.894
also. So talking about the chemical law of

01:21.932 --> 01:25.910
equivalence, okay, talking about the chemical law of equivalence, the law

01:25.980 --> 01:29.854
state that one equivalent of element combines

01:29.922 --> 01:33.366
with the one equivalent of the other. Okay? So one equivalent

01:33.398 --> 01:37.066
of the element combines with the one equivalent of the other, okay?

01:37.168 --> 01:40.438
So here, if there are some equivalent, okay,

01:40.544 --> 01:44.190
then we can assume that whatever the equivalent of this compound is

01:44.340 --> 01:48.000
consumed, same amount of equivalent will be consumed for B,

01:48.450 --> 01:52.366
okay? And similarly same equivalent of C

01:52.388 --> 01:55.578
will be formed and same equivalent of D will be formed. This is what

01:55.604 --> 01:59.378
the statement of first says that whatever the equivalent of one

01:59.464 --> 02:03.106
is consumed, other also is consumed in the same ratio. Other also is

02:03.128 --> 02:06.898
consumed in the same ratio. Okay? So this is what the statement says.

02:06.984 --> 02:10.662
This is what the statement says that the law state that one

02:10.716 --> 02:14.594
equivalent of the element combines with the one equivalent of the other. So easily

02:14.642 --> 02:18.226
we can say that whatever the equivalent of A is there, it will be equal

02:18.258 --> 02:21.546
to the equivalent of B and it will be equivalent equal to the equivalent of

02:21.568 --> 02:24.346
C, it will be equal to the equivalent of D, okay?

02:24.448 --> 02:27.750
Similarly, here there is another statement.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.326
These two statements can be combinedly read, okay? So in a

02:31.348 --> 02:35.290
chemical reaction equivalent or mill equivalent

02:35.370 --> 02:39.182
of a reactant react in an equal amount to give the

02:39.316 --> 02:42.718
same number of equivalent or the mill equivalent of the product

02:42.804 --> 02:46.722
separately. So this is the simple statement here. This A and B are

02:46.776 --> 02:50.434
basically consumed amount, okay? Here A and B are basically the

02:50.472 --> 02:53.810
consumed amount. So these are the consumed amount while

02:53.960 --> 02:57.202
this C and D are formed amount, okay? While this

02:57.256 --> 03:00.726
C and d are the formed amount, okay? This C and D

03:00.748 --> 03:04.374
are actually the formed amount, okay? So these are the formed amount

03:04.412 --> 03:07.926
of the substance while this is the consumed amount of the substance. But they will

03:07.948 --> 03:11.402
be equal. But they will be equal. You don't need

03:11.456 --> 03:14.874
a balanced reaction. Remember that. I'm saying it again.

03:14.992 --> 03:18.278
The biggest advantage of chemical law of equivalence

03:18.294 --> 03:21.686
that it can be applied. It can be applied I'm writing here as a note

03:21.718 --> 03:25.178
point to this point, okay? That law of equivalence

03:25.194 --> 03:28.366
can be applied to unbalanced chemical reaction. And that is the

03:28.388 --> 03:32.254
biggest advantage why we use law of equivalence, okay? So we can

03:32.292 --> 03:35.506
say here that law of equivalence we

03:35.528 --> 03:39.266
can say here that law of equivalence law of

03:39.288 --> 03:43.250
equivalence is applicable

03:43.590 --> 03:48.102
is applicable even to

03:48.156 --> 03:52.070
those reaction even to those reaction

03:52.410 --> 03:57.894
which are even to those reaction which are not

03:58.012 --> 04:01.446
balanced. Which are not balanced, okay? So this is

04:01.468 --> 04:04.822
the biggest advantage and generally applied to

04:04.956 --> 04:08.054
those reactions which are of redox nature, okay?

04:08.092 --> 04:11.502
Because balancing of redox is quite tough of so generally without

04:11.556 --> 04:14.622
balancing, we apply the law of equivalence to get the final product amount

04:14.676 --> 04:17.886
or the reactant consumed amount. Okay? So this is the method and

04:17.908 --> 04:21.386
this is what we call it chemical law of equivalence.

04:21.418 --> 04:24.080
Okay? So I hope that this is clear to you.
