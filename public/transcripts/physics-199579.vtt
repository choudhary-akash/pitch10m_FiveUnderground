00:03.450 --> 00:06.942
Now, the first two terms that we need to understand are,

00:06.996 --> 00:10.366
firstly, distance. Now, distance, like it says here,

00:10.388 --> 00:14.074
is the length of the actual path traveled between the initial

00:14.122 --> 00:17.966
and final positions. So if I am over here

00:18.068 --> 00:21.486
and I walk to some other place, take the roads and walk to some

00:21.508 --> 00:25.154
other place, then distance is how much I walked.

00:25.322 --> 00:28.866
Even if you look at GPS or even if you look at navigation

00:28.898 --> 00:32.706
in your phones, that path that they trace out, that length of the path

00:32.738 --> 00:36.790
that they show you, these many kilometers you need to travel, that is the distance.

00:37.130 --> 00:40.322
That path may be curved. That path may be circular.

00:40.386 --> 00:43.674
It can have any shape, but it just tells you from this

00:43.712 --> 00:47.100
point to this point how much path you actually need to cover.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.870
The other part to this is called the displacement.

00:51.030 --> 00:54.554
And displacement is said to be the shortest straight line distance

00:54.682 --> 00:57.774
directed from the initial position to the final position,

00:57.892 --> 01:01.278
irrespective of the path. In order to better understand

01:01.364 --> 01:04.698
this, look at this diagram over here. So suppose this is my

01:04.724 --> 01:07.826
point A. This is point A, and I need

01:07.848 --> 01:11.170
to go from this point A all the way to this point

01:11.240 --> 01:14.498
B. Now, because there are obstacles in between,

01:14.584 --> 01:17.758
let's assume that there are roads and everything. So I cannot go

01:17.784 --> 01:21.314
straight from this point to the other. So I go a bit in this direction,

01:21.362 --> 01:25.462
then I go up, so on, so forth, and I

01:25.516 --> 01:29.254
come back to this point. This entire yellow

01:29.302 --> 01:33.114
line, this is the distance, because this is actually the path that I have

01:33.152 --> 01:36.554
taken. However, the displacement is

01:36.592 --> 01:40.426
the shortest distance between those two points. And whenever you

01:40.448 --> 01:43.934
want the shortest distance between these two points, they will

01:43.972 --> 01:47.534
generally be the straight line connecting them. So this

01:47.572 --> 01:50.894
yellow line is the distance. The red line is the

01:50.932 --> 01:54.814
displacement. It's the shortest distance possible. So you immediately

01:54.862 --> 01:58.990
get an idea over here that the distance cannot

01:59.070 --> 02:03.138
be less than the displacement. The displacement is the least value

02:03.224 --> 02:06.706
that the distance can have. Because if I want to go from point A

02:06.728 --> 02:10.054
to point B, suppose there are no obstacles in between,

02:10.172 --> 02:13.480
the actual path that I can travel would be just this line.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.910
In that case, my distance becomes equal to my displacement.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.050
So displacement is the minimum value.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.146
Distance will either be that value or it will be greater than that if

02:25.168 --> 02:29.206
I take any other path. All right, so displacement

02:29.318 --> 02:33.242
also another important thing. Displacement is a vector quantity.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.606
Why? Because displacement, since it's in a straight line,

02:36.708 --> 02:40.062
it also has a defined direction. And because

02:40.116 --> 02:44.250
of that direction, displacement becomes a vector quantity. But distance,

02:44.410 --> 02:47.666
distance is a scalar quantity. That is why if you look at

02:47.688 --> 02:51.714
this path, this entire path has no fixed direction for

02:51.752 --> 02:55.554
this region. Up till this region, I'm moving in that side.

02:55.672 --> 02:59.414
Then I move up, then I move again to that side, I move down,

02:59.452 --> 03:02.402
and so on. So my direction is constantly changing.

03:02.546 --> 03:06.162
So for distance, you do not have a defined direction, hence it's a scalar.

03:06.226 --> 03:09.666
But for displacement, because it's a straight line and that direction

03:09.698 --> 03:13.530
is maintained throughout, you consider displacement to be a vector.

03:14.030 --> 03:17.834
All right? So I hope the concepts of distance and displacement are clear, because these

03:17.872 --> 03:19.260
will be used quite often.

03:20.910 --> 03:24.474
Now, another example to properly illustrate distance

03:24.522 --> 03:28.154
and displacement. So over here, I have a particle

03:28.202 --> 03:31.566
that moves like it says it moves over the arc PQ on

03:31.588 --> 03:34.800
a circle of radius, capital R. So over here,

03:36.290 --> 03:40.226
this is the path actually taken. So if this is the

03:40.248 --> 03:43.026
path through which the particle moves, the points that it needs to go is from

03:43.048 --> 03:46.306
point P all the way to point Q. So this

03:46.328 --> 03:49.894
is the actual path taken, which means the distance is

03:49.932 --> 03:53.094
the arc length PQ. You can even figure out if

03:53.132 --> 03:57.458
theta is given and the radius is given R. You know, this PQ

03:57.554 --> 04:01.434
is just equal to R theta. You can even figure that out.

04:01.632 --> 04:05.066
That is the distance traveled. And because you're going from

04:05.088 --> 04:08.714
point P to point Q, you can even figure out what the

04:08.752 --> 04:11.994
displacement is going to be. The displacement is

04:12.032 --> 04:15.758
going to be this line over here. Now, that is not the path you

04:15.764 --> 04:18.926
have taken, but that is the shortest distance between the two because

04:18.948 --> 04:22.602
it's a straight line connecting those two points. So displacement

04:22.666 --> 04:25.850
is a straight line PQ. See? It's still PQ.

04:25.930 --> 04:29.662
In both of these cases, it's PQ because it's the same points you're going

04:29.796 --> 04:33.278
to you're going from one point to the other is the same points.

04:33.444 --> 04:37.106
However, the path taken ensures the distance becomes the arc,

04:37.218 --> 04:39.720
and displacement becomes the straight line.

04:40.730 --> 04:41.140
All right.
