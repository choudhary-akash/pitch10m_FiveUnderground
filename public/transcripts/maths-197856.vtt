Hello and welcome back. Children, today we are going to learn measurement

00:04.090 --> 00:07.646
of an angle. How to measure an angle. So are

00:07.668 --> 00:11.306
you guys ready? Let us begin. Such Au

00:11.338 --> 00:14.958
and P who are playing a game with math sticks. They are making different

00:15.044 --> 00:18.670
angles using math sticks. Let us see such children.

00:18.740 --> 00:22.240
First, it is P whose turn she says, let me play first.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.114
And she makes an angle using the the mat sticks.

00:26.162 --> 00:29.654
Okay, now these mat sticks are bigger so that you can see

00:29.692 --> 00:33.474
it. Generally the mat sticks are smaller. Okay. So this angle

00:33.522 --> 00:36.854
is created by P Who. But how to measure this

00:36.892 --> 00:40.458
angle? Children, do you know how to measure this angle? Let us see.

00:40.544 --> 00:44.074
So first of all, is this acute or is

00:44.112 --> 00:47.354
this Obtuse? Children, let us see my hand here.

00:47.472 --> 00:51.130
Suppose this is right angle. L shape

00:51.290 --> 00:55.262
less than L shape. This is acute. More than

00:55.316 --> 00:58.814
L shape. Obtuse. Yes. So this one is

00:58.932 --> 01:02.414
this one is less than L shape. This is

01:02.532 --> 01:06.270
acute angle. Okay. Now one more thing you need to measure.

01:06.350 --> 01:10.098
This is a protractor. This you will find in

01:10.104 --> 01:13.314
your geometry boxes. Now you can

01:13.352 --> 01:16.930
see in the protractor there are two type of numbers

01:17.000 --> 01:20.278
written here. 50 is written. I'll zoom in a

01:20.284 --> 01:24.498
little bit here. 50 is written and 130 is written.

01:24.594 --> 01:28.254
Now children, you just now saw that this is an acute

01:28.322 --> 01:32.666
angle. Acute angle also mean less than 90.

01:32.848 --> 01:36.554
So children, which one will I choose? 130 or 50

01:36.672 --> 01:40.734
which is less than 90? Yes, you are absolutely correct.

01:40.852 --> 01:44.014
50 is the correct answer for this one.

01:44.132 --> 01:48.458
So children, here the measure of this angle

01:48.554 --> 01:51.934
is 50 degrees. Now let us see

01:51.972 --> 01:56.326
what IU has to do. Now it's my turn, says IU.

01:56.458 --> 02:00.318
So again, using two mat sticks, he makes another angle.

02:00.414 --> 02:03.762
Again, children, how to measure this angle? What is the first

02:03.816 --> 02:07.314
step? We need to check if this is acute or Obtuse.

02:07.362 --> 02:11.302
Again, children, this is less than L shape. Less than

02:11.356 --> 02:14.694
L shape. So this is acute. Now let us put the

02:14.732 --> 02:18.454
protractor here. This protractor is also D

02:18.492 --> 02:21.226
shaped. Can you see? This is D shape. Yes.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.874
Now look at the protractor. Once again, you can

02:24.912 --> 02:28.714
see 70. You can see 110. Since this

02:28.752 --> 02:32.574
is acute, this is less than 90. Which one will I

02:32.612 --> 02:36.686
choose? Yes, children, I will choose the 70.

02:36.868 --> 02:40.734
So IU made an angle of 70

02:40.932 --> 02:44.586
degrees. So this is what P who. And IU made.

02:44.708 --> 02:48.258
Now let us try some more examples. Look at this one. Children,

02:48.424 --> 02:52.526
first step, what do we need to check? Is this acute or optus?

02:52.638 --> 02:55.982
This is more than more than L shape.

02:56.046 --> 02:59.366
More than 90. This is optus. So we will

02:59.388 --> 03:03.014
put the protractor. Now here it is 30.

03:03.132 --> 03:07.126
Here it is 150. Look here. Here it is 30.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.218
Here it is 150. So which one will I choose?

03:10.384 --> 03:14.266
This is Obtuse angle more than 90. So I

03:14.288 --> 03:18.234
will choose the other one. I will choose 150.

03:18.352 --> 03:22.142
In this case. Okay, children, one more example very quickly.

03:22.276 --> 03:25.374
Come on. This is less than L shape again.

03:25.492 --> 03:29.210
This is less than L shape again. So this is acute angle.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.982
Let's put the protractor here. Now, children,

03:32.116 --> 03:35.806
again I'll zoom in. So this is acute less

03:35.828 --> 03:39.246
than 90. So will I choose 50 or will I choose 130? Which one,

03:39.268 --> 03:42.766
children? Yes. Very good. I will choose the

03:42.868 --> 03:46.438
50 again. So in this case the correct answer is

03:46.524 --> 03:49.782
50 degrees. That's all from my side. Children,

03:49.916 --> 03:53.334
you all find out more such interesting angles and see

03:53.372 --> 03:55.158
me next time. Until then,
